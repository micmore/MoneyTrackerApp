# MoneyTrackerApp
This app is like a digital wallet that helps you keep an eye on how much money you're spending and what you're spending it on. When you buy something, you tell the app how much it cost and what kind of thing it was like gas for your car, groceries, fun stuff, clothes, or your bill
